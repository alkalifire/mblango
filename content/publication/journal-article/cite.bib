abstract = {Th17 cells provide protection at barrier tissues but may also contribute to immune pathology. The relevance and induction mechanisms of pathologic Th17 responses in humans are poorly understood. Here, we identify the mucocutaneous pathobiont Candida albicans as the major direct inducer of human anti-fungal Th17 cells. Th17 cells directed against other fungi are induced by cross-reactivity to C. albicans. Intestinal inflammation expands total C. albicans and cross-reactive Th17 cells. Strikingly, Th17 cells cross-reactive to the airborne fungus Aspergillus fumigatus are selectively activated and expanded in patients with airway inflammation, especially during acute allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. This indicates a direct link between protective intestinal Th17 responses against C. albicans and lung inflammation caused by airborne fungi. We identify heterologous immunity to a single, ubiquitous member of the microbiota as a central mechanism for systemic induction of human anti-fungal Th17 responses and as a potential risk factor for pulmonary inflammatory diseases. Human anti-fungal Th17 immunity and pathology rely on cross-reactivity against Candida albicans.},

abstract = {Endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) must be intricately regulated in mammals to prevent aberrant activation of host inflammatory pathways by cytosolic dsRNA binding proteins. Here we define the long, endogenous dsRNA repertoire in mammalian macrophages and monocytes during the inflammatory response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Hyperediting by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) enzymes was quantified over time using RNA-Seq data from activated mouse macrophages to identify 342 Editing Enriched Regions (EERs), indicative of highly structured dsRNA. Analysis of publicly available datasets for samples of human peripheral blood monocytes resulted in discovery of 3,438 EERs in the human transcriptome. Human EERs had predicted secondary structures that were significantly more stable than those of mouse EERs and were located primarily in introns, whereas nearly all mouse EERs were in 3'UTRs. Seventy-four mouse EER-associated genes contained an EER in the orthologous human gene, although nucleotide sequence and position were only rarely conserved. Among these conserved EER-associated genes were several TNF-signaling genes, including Sppl2a and Tnfrsf1b, important for processing and recognition of TNF, respectively. Using publicly available data and experimental validation, we found that a significant proportion of EERs accumulated in the nucleus, a strategy that may prevent aberrant activation of proinflammatory cascades in the cytoplasm. The observation of many ADAR-edited dsRNAs in mammalian immune cells, a subset of which are in orthologous genes of mouse and human, suggests a conserved role for these structured regions.},

abstract = {Numerous antibiotics have proven to be effective at ameliorating the clinical symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTIs), but recurrent and chronic infections continue to plague many individuals. Most UTIs are caused by strains of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which can form both extra- and intracellular biofilm-like communities within the bladder. UPEC also persist inside host urothelial cells in a more quiescent state, sequestered within late endosomal compartments. Here, we tested a panel of 17 different antibiotics, representing seven distinct functional classes, for their effects on the survival of the reference UPEC isolate UTI89 within both biofilms and host bladder urothelial cells. All but one of the tested antibiotics prevented UTI89 growth in broth culture, and most were at least modestly effective against bacteria present within in vitro-grown biofilms. In contrast, only a few of the antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin and the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, were able to eliminate intracellular bacteria in bladder cell culture-based assays. However, in a mouse UTI model system in which these antibiotics reached concentrations in the urine specimens that far exceeded minimal inhibitory doses, UPEC reservoirs in bladder tissues were not effectively eradicated. We conclude that the persistence of UPEC within the bladder, regardless of antibiotic treatments, is likely facilitated by a combination of biofilm formation, entry of UPEC into a quiescent or semiquiescent state within host cells, and the stalwart permeability barrier function associated with the bladder urothelium.},

Although quorum sensing has received the bulk of attention for many years, contact-dependent signaling is forging a niche in the research world with the identification of novel systems and the emergence of more mechanistic data. Contact-dependent signaling is probably a common strategy by which bacteria in close contact, such as within biofilms, can modulate the growth and behavior of both siblings and competitors. Ongoing work with diverse bacterial systems, including Myxococcus xanthus, pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, Bacillus subtilis, and dissimilatory metal-reducing soil bacteria, is providing increasingly detailed insight into the dynamic mechanisms and potential of contact-dependent signaling processes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Intracellular quiescent reservoirs of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which can seed the bladder mucosa during the acute phase of a urinary tract infection (UTI), are protected from antibiotic treatments and are extremely difficult to eliminate. These reservoirs are a potential source for recurrent UTIs that affect millions annually. Here, using murine infection models and the bladder cell exfoliant chitosan, we demonstrate that intracellular UPEC populations shift within the stratified layers of the urothelium during the course of a UTI. Following invasion of the terminally differentiated superficial layer of epithelial cells that line the bladder lumen, UPEC can multiply and disseminate, eventually establishing reservoirs within underlying immature host cells. If given access, UPEC can invade the superficial and immature bladder cells equally well. As infected immature host cells differentiate and migrate towards the apical surface of the bladder, UPEC can reinitiate growth and discharge into the bladder lumen. By inducing the exfoliation of the superficial layers of the urothelium, chitosan stimulates rapid regenerative processes and the reactivation and efflux of quiescent intracellular UPEC reservoirs. When combined with antibiotics, chitosan treatment significantly reduces bacterial loads within the bladder and may therefore be of therapeutic value to individuals with chronic, recurrent UTIs.},

Infection of immature urothelial cells can result in the formation of persistent intracellular reservoirs that are refractory to antibiotic treatments. Previously, we defined a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing the bladder cell exfoliant chitosan to deplete UPEC reservoirs. However, though a single treatment of chitosan followed by ciprofloxacin administration had a marked effect on reducing UPEC titers within the bladder, this treatment failed to prevent relapsing bacteriuria. We show here that repeated application of chitosan in conjuction with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, completely eradicates UPEC from the urinary tract and prevents the development of relapsing bouts of bacteruria. In addition, microscopy revealed rapid restoration of bladder integrity following chitosan treatment, indicating that chitosan can be used to effectively combat recalcitrant bladder infections without causing any lasting harm to the urothelium.},

abstract = {Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase protein involved in the homeostasis of inflammatory responses and appears to be a vital host defense component with protective anti-infective properties. SAA expression remains poorly defined in many tissues, including the urinary tract which often faces bacterial challenge. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are usually caused by strains of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) and frequently occur among otherwise healthy individuals, many of whom experience bouts of recurrent and relapsing infections despite the use of antibiotics. To date, whether SAA is present in the infected urothelium and whether or not the induction of SAA can protect the host against UPEC is unclear. Here we show, using mouse models coupled with immunofluorescence microscopy and quantitative RT-PCR, that delivery of UPEC either directly into the urinary tract via catheterization or systemically via intraperitoneal injection triggers the expression of SAA. As measured by ELISA, serum levels of SAA1/2 were also transiently elevated in response to UTI, but circulating SAA3 levels were only up-regulated substantially following intraperitoneal inoculation of UPEC. In in vitro assays, physiological relevant levels of SAA1/2 did not affect the growth or viability of UPEC, but were able to block biofilm formation by the uropathogens. We suggest that SAA functions as a critical host defense against UTIs, preventing the formation of biofilms both upon and within the urothelium and possibly providing clinicians with a sensitive serological marker for UTI.},

abstract = { Aspergillus fumigatus is a common airborne fungal pathogen of humans and a significant source of mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Here, we provide the most extensive cell wall proteome profiling to date of A. fumigatus resting conidia, the fungal morphotype pertinent to first contact with the host. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we identified proteins within the conidial cell wall by hydrogen-fluoride (HF)–pyridine extraction and proteins exposed on the surface using a trypsin-shaving approach. One protein, designated c onidial c ell wall p rotein A (CcpA), was identified by both methods and was found to be nearly as abundant as hydrophobic rodlet layer-forming protein RodA. CcpA, an amphiphilic protein, like RodA, peaks in expression during sporulation on resting conidia. Despite high cell wall abundance, the cell surface structure of $\Delta$ ccpA resting conidia appeared normal. However, trypsin shaving of $\Delta$ ccpA conidia revealed novel surface-exposed proteins not detected on conidia of the wild-type strain. Interestingly, the presence of swollen $\Delta$ ccpA conidia led to higher activation of neutrophils and dendritic cells than was seen with wild-type conidia and caused significantly less damage to epithelial cells in vitro . In addition, virulence was highly attenuated when cortisone-treated, immunosuppressed mice were infected with $\Delta$ ccpA conidia. CcpA-specific memory T cell responses were detectable in healthy human donors naturally exposed to A. fumigatus conidia, suggesting a role for CcpA as a structural protein impacting conidial immunogenicity rather than possessing a protein-intrinsic immunosuppressive effect. Together, these data suggest that CcpA serves as a conidial stealth protein by altering the conidial surface structure to minimize innate immune recognition.  IMPORTANCE The mammalian immune system relies on recognition of pathogen surface antigens for targeting and clearance. In the absence of immune evasion strategies, pathogen clearance is rapid. In the case of Aspergillus fumigatus , the successful fungus must avoid phagocytosis in the lung to establish invasive infection. In healthy individuals, fungal spores are cleared by immune cells; however, in immunocompromised patients, clearance mechanisms are impaired. Here, using proteome analyses, we identified CcpA as an important fungal spore protein involved in pathogenesis. A. fumigatus lacking CcpA was more susceptible to immune recognition and prompt eradication and, consequently, exhibited drastically attenuated virulence. In infection studies, CcpA was required for virulence in infected immunocompromised mice, suggesting that it could be used as a possible immunotherapeutic or diagnostic target in the future. In summary, our report adds a protein to the list of those known to be critical to the complex fungal spore surface environment and, more importantly, identifies a protein important for conidial immunogenicity during infection. },

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. Fungal spores are one of several environmental factors responsible for causing respiratory diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aspergillosis. These spores also are able to trigger exacerbations during chronic forms of disease. Different fungal spores may contain different allergens and mycotoxins, therefore the health hazards are varying between the species. Thus it is highly important quickly to identify the composition of fungal spores in the air. In this study, UV-Raman spectroscopy with an excitation wavelength of 244 nm was applied to investigate eight different fungal species implicated in respiratory diseases worldwide. Here, we demonstrate that darkly colored spores can be directly examined, and UV-Raman spectroscopy provides the information sufficient for classifying fungal spores. Classification models on the genus, species, and strain levels were built using a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) followed by evaluation with leave-one-batch-out-cross-validation (LBOCV). At the genus level an accuracy of 97.5{\%} was achieved, whereas on the species level four different Aspergillus species were classified with 100{\%} accuracy. Finally, classifying three strains of Aspergillus fumigatus an accuracy of 89.4{\%} was reached. These results demonstrate that UV-Raman spectroscopy in combination with innovative chemometrics allows for fast identification of fungal spores and can be a potential alternative to currently used time-consuming cultivation.},
