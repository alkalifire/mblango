  abstract = {Fungal spores and hyphal fragments are major contributors to the allergic response in the human lung. In this study, we used a trypsin-shaving-proteomics approach to identify the surface-exposed and secreted/shed proteins of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia. We investigated the surface proteome under different conditions, including temperature variation and germination. We found that the surface proteome of resting A. fumigatus conidia is not static, but instead unexpectedly dynamic, as evidenced by drastically different surface proteomes under different growth conditions. Knockouts of two abundant A. fumigatus surface proteins, ScwA and CweA, were found to function only in fine-tuning the cell wall stress response, implying that the conidial surface is also very robust. We then compared the surface proteome of A. fumigatus to other allergy-inducing molds, including Alternaria alternata, Penicillium rubens, and Cladosporium herbarum, and performed comparative proteomics on resting and swollen conidia, as well as secreted proteins from germinating conidia. We detected 125 protein ortholog groups, including 80 with putative catalytic activity, in the extracellular region of all four molds, and 42 nonorthologous proteins produced solely by A. fumigatus. Ultimately, this study highlights the dynamic nature of the conidial surface and provides numerous targets for future diagnostics and immunotherapy... \The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
