I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia in the US state of Pennsylvania. After highschool, I moved north to attend Boston University, where I received a Bachelor of the Arts in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and was particularly interested in infectious disease. After obtaining my B.A., I hopped over to Utah, where I earned my PhD in Microbiology and Immunology studying the pathogenesis biochemistry of uropathogenic *Escherichia coli* with Prof. Matt Mulvey at the University of Utah. I followed my PhD with a postdoctoral fellowship defining the endogenous pool of double-stranded RNA in mammalian immune cells with Prof. Brenda Bass. 

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow and small group leader studying fungal biology and pathogenesis at the Leibniz-HKI in Jena, Germany with Prof. Axel Brakhage. My work here is centered on the conidial (spore) surface proteome, the extracellular vesicle biology of host-pathogenesis, and the importance of non-coding RNA in fungi. In the future, I hope to be able to establish my own group focused on harnessing our knowledge of extacellular vesicles and non-coding RNA for the development of RNA-based therapeutics and diagnostics for the treatment of fungal infections. Maybe we can work on these problems together?
